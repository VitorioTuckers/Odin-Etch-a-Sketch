## Description

This is a simple vanilla Javascript paint like web application. You can paint the canvas by clicking and holding your mouse button (Mouse 1) and dragging it. There are multiple colors to choose from in the color picker and a rainbow option that generates a random RGB color for each pixel the mouse cursor passes through, also a size selector for choosing the grid size (Max is 100x100) and two extra buttons, one for clearing the canvas and the other for selecting the eraser.
